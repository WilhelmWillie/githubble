# GitHubble

Introducing GitHubble, Your friendly tool for finding GitHub repositories.

The goal in building this tool was to practice GitHub Flow practices (e.g. branches for new features, atomic commits, PR as tools for review) as well as to re-acquaint myself with Angular 2 (architecture, components, services, etc). 

For easy, simple, and beautiful styles, GitHubble uses [Bulma](http://bulma.io), a modern CSS framework built on FlexBox. In addition, this project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.

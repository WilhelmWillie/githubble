# GitHubble

Introducing GitHubble, Your friendly tool for finding GitHub repositories.

The goal in building this tool was to practice GitHub Flow practices (e.g. branches for new features, treating commits like pages in a book) as well as to re-acquaint myself with Angular 2. 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.1.1.
